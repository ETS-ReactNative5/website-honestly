        The BMW Museum in Munich, Germany was opened in 1973 as one of the first brand museums.
        Displayed over 5,000 square metres of exhibition space are around 125 of the brand’s most
        precious and appealing cars, motorcycles and engines.
        The Museum is a living building, comprising many innovative and immersive exhibitions that
        exude BMW’s passion for technical innovation. BMW wanted to live that brand through the
        museum’s web presence, and turned to Red Badger to discover how.
